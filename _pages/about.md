Hello &nbsp; নমস্কার &nbsp; Bonjour! 
My name is Anuvabh. I'm a machine learning researcher, based in Paris, France.

I'm interested in all things ```machine learning``` and all things ```code```. Currently I'm working on:
- Scalable and efficient machine learning algorithms
- Software tools and frameworks to help people use machine learning systems
